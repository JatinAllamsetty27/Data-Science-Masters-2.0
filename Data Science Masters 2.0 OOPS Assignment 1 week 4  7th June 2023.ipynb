    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) together within a class. It allows the class to control the access to its internal data, providing data hiding and abstraction. Encapsulation helps in achieving better code organization, modularity, and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. The class that is inherited from is called the parent class or superclass, and the class that inherits is called the child class or subclass. Inheritance promotes code reuse, allows for the creation of specialized classes, and facilitates the concept of \"is-a\" relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables code flexibility and extensibility by providing methods with the same name but different implementations in different classes. It allows for method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components. It involves creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a common set of properties and behaviors for a group of related objects. Abstraction hides the internal details of objects and focuses on their essential characteristics. It allows for code reusability, modularity, and the creation of hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars of OOP work together to provide a powerful and flexible programming paradigm for designing and implementing complex systems. They promote code organization, modularity, reusability, and maintainability."
