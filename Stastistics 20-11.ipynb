    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Nominal: This is the most basic level of measurement. Nominal scales categorize data without any order. Variables at this level are qualitative and can't be logically ordered. Examples include gender, nationality, or race.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>Ordinal: This level of measurement deals with data that can be ordered or ranked, but the differences between the data points can't be determined or are meaningless. An example is a satisfaction survey with responses such as \"very satisfied,\" \"satisfied,\" \"neutral,\" \"dissatisfied,\" and \"very dissatisfied.\"\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>Interval: At this level, the data can be ordered, and the exact differences between the values are meaningful. However, there is no true zero point. Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit is a common example, as the difference between degrees is the same, but 0 does not indicate the absence of temperature.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>Ratio: This is the highest level of measurement and includes all the properties of the interval level, but also has a meaningful zero point, which indicates the absence of the variable being measured. Examples include height, weight, and income.\n",

    "Purpose: Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the features of a dataset. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. These summaries may be either quantitative, i.e., summary statistics, or visual, i.e., charts and plots.\n",
    "Tools: Common tools include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation), and frequency distribution tables, histograms, bar charts, and pie charts.\n",
    "Example: If a school principal wants to understand the overall academic performance of students, they might use descriptive statistics to calculate the average score of all students in a standardized test or create a histogram to visualize the distribution of scores.\n",

    "**Inferential Statistics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Inferential statistics are used to make inferences or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data taken from that population. It involves making predictions or decisions, estimating properties, testing hypotheses, and deriving estimates and their reliability.\n",
    "Tools: Common tools include hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests), confidence intervals, regression analysis, and analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n",
    "Example: If a medical researcher wants to determine whether a new drug is effective, they would use inferential statistics. They might calculate the confidence interval for the difference in recovery rates between groups who received the drug versus a placebo or conduct a hypothesis test to see if any observed effects are statistically significant."
