    "**Exception:** An Exception is an event that occours between during the execution of a program that disrupts the  normal form of instructions. It is a way to handle errors or exceptional conditions. When an exception occurs, it creates an object containing information about the error, and the program's normal flow is interrupted, transferring control to a special block of code known as an exception handler.\n",
    "Exceptions can be caused by various factors, such as invalid input, unavailable resources, or logical errors. Some common types of exceptions in Python include TypeError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, and FileNotFoundError, among others. You can also create custom exceptions by deriving from the built-in Exception class or its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax Errors:** Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that violates the language's syntax rules. These errors happen during the parsing stage, before the program is executed. Syntax errors typically prevent the program from running at all, as the interpreter cannot understand the code. Common examples of syntax errors include misspelled keywords, missing colons or parentheses, or incorrect indentation."
