On Windows, you can press Win + R, type \"cmd,\" and press Enter. On macOS, you can use Spotlight search to find and open the Terminal application. On Linux, you can use the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T to open a terminal emulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Navigate to the script's directory: Use the **cd** command (Change Directory) in the command line to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. For example, if your script is located in **C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Scripts**, you would use the command **cd C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Scripts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Execute the script: Once you are in the correct directory, you can execute the Python script by typing **python** followed by the script's filename (including the **.py** extension). For example, you would run the script **script.py** by typing **python script.py** in the command line and pressing Enter.\n",
